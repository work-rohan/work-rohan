# ROHAN DJ

## Introduction

Hello,

I am Rohan DJ. My current residence is at Cherthala, Alappuzha. I am pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at the Toc H Institute of Science and Technology, Cochin.

My journey in the world of technology has been marked by a deep passion for coding, gaming, and web development. My educational foundation was laid at the prestigious ST Joseph Public School Pattanakad, where I developed a strong academic base and a thirst for knowledge. Beyond academics, my interests extend to competitive gaming, where I constantly challenge myself to excel. 

I have a strong affinity for technical articles and have a genuine love for exploring new horizons and delving deeper into uncharted territories of unknown facts. I fill my leisure times enjoying music.With a mix of academic pursuits and extracurricular interests, I am excited to explore new opportunities and collaborate with like-minded individuals. I believe that my combination of technical skills, creativity, and dedication will enable me to contribute effectively to any team.
